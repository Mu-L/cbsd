# FreeBSD: XEN DOM0

## Introduction

Starting from **CBSD** 10.3.0 experimental support of [**XEN**](http://xenproject.org/) hypervisor has been added

Since CBSD provides only a script wrapper to work with XEN, for their work you need to hold the system configuration in accordance with the documentation [**XEN FreeBSD Dom0**](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/FreeBSD_Dom0)

To create and operate with XEN through the CBSD, use the prefix **x** for the corresponding commands: xconstruct-tui, xls, xstop, xstart, xremove
